# a summary about you
summary: |
  I am a passionate Platform Engineer with 10 years of working experience. 

  I started my career as a Java Developer, where I got experience with applications architectures, clean code, and the software development lifecycle. 
  
  After 2 years I switched to a DevOps role where I am responsible for keeping running up and safe the infrastructure delivering automation for daily work. In daily work, I am sharing my knowledge with other teams, by developer mentoring from used tools or by presenting the PoC of tools that are addressing met problems around work.
