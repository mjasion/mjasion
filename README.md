# Hi, I'm Marcin

SRE & Platform Engineer from Warsaw, Poland.

I build reliable systems with **Kubernetes**, write code in **Go**, and deploy on **Cloudflare** and **Vercel**. On the side, I explore **TanStack**, build with **Claude Code**, and tinker with new tools.

I write about what I learn at [mjasion.pl/blog](https://mjasion.pl/blog).
